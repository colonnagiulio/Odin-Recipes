                <h2>Why Spaghetti?</h2>

                    <p>There's nothing like classic spaghetti and meat sauce to bring people together around the dinner table. This homemade spaghetti sauce with ground beef recipe will satisfy all your comfort food cravings.</p>
                    <p>Some historians think that Arabs introduced pasta to Europe during a conquest of Sicily. In the West, it may have first been worked into long, thin forms in Sicily around the 12th century, as the Tabula Rogeriana of Muhammad al-Idrisi attested, reporting some traditions about the Sicilian kingdom.</p>

                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
                <li>2 (28 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
                <li>Â¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
                <h2>How To Prepare Spaguetti</h2>
        <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.</li>
                <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook the bacon in the oil until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir the onion, celery, carrot, and oregano into the bacon; continue cooking until the vegetables begin to soften, another 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Crumble the ground beef into the vegetable mixture; cook and stir until the beef is completely cooked and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour the balsamic vinegar over the ground beef mixture; allow to simmer until the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Stir the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar into the ground beef mixture; bring the mixture to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, and remove from heat. Stir the fresh basil into the mixture.</li>
                <li>Ladle the sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Top with Parmesan cheese to serve.</li>
        </ol>
